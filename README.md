**An X-ray calibration comprehensive approach - not disruptive to clinical flow**

Here we will provide details of our X-ray calibration approach developped in the context of 3D reconstruction of the proximal femur for total hip arthroplasty (THA).
Our contribution being under review, we will publish supplementary material and code snippets once the reviewing process completed.
